Anomaly detection in log files project.

This repository presents the work done on anomaly detection in log data. Two important files to see further information are:

- `DATA586_Project_Report.pdf`: This file presents the findings in an ACM research paper format.
- `Milestone_Files`: Contains video demonstration presenting our work.

Some intermediary work is present in working folder, while the Models and Parsing folders have third-party code used in our project.
