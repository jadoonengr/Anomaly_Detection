# Anomaly_Detection
Anomaly detection in log files project.

This repository presents the work done on anomaly detection in log data. Some important files to get further information are:  

- `Example.ipynb`: This file contains the code that we implemented for log parsing, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation in Python.
- `DATA586_Project_Report.pdf`: This file presents the findings in an ACM research paper format.
- `Milestone_Files`: This folder contains video demonstration presenting our work.

Some intermediary work is present in working folder, while the Models and Parsing folders have third-party code used in our project.
